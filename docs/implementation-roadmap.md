- **Incremental Deployment**: Each phase should be deployable
- **Performance Monitoring**: Benchmark every major change
- **Documentation**: Keep docs updated with each phase
- **Community Feedback**: Regular testing with Nostr ecosystem

This roadmap ensures systematic evolution from the current Todo foundation to a production-ready Nostr relay capable of serving the OpenAgents AI ecosystem at scale.
